TrayIconKit
===========

Introduction
------------
TrayIconKit is a GNUstep framework that provides simple access to a system tray,

all the nasty X11 details.
Currently, two types of icons are supported:
- simple images, displaying an icon and possibly a tooltip
- buttons, displaying an icon and a tooltip and being able to execute any action
  when clicked.
